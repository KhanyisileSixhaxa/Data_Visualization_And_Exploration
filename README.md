# Data_Visualization_And_Exploration

Introduction to Data Visualisation & Exploration. Understanding, cleaning
and preparing data is fundamental to any data analysis project: data scientists spend 80%+ of
their time cleaning and manipulating data, and only 20% of their time actually analysing it. This
guides which data mining and modelling techniques are appropriate for the situation, and should
be undertaken before these steps are applied.
Exploratory data analysis is used as a tool to understand the underlying structure of data whilst
uncovering features and relationships, typically without an a priori understanding of what the data
might contain. This aids in identifying anomalies, missing values, and evaluating data integrity.
In increasingly large datasets, the relationships and patterns can become more complex and less
intuitive, requiring specialised techniques to uncover the structure. A key aspect of data exploration
is reducing the complexity of the data by  nding suitable ways of summarising the data, or reducing
the dimensionality, whilst minimising information loss. Visualising the data is a powerful way
of doing this, providing e ective communication of information using an intuitive representation
of key insights into complex datasets, which is particularly useful for humans to understand |
visualisation allows for analysis, exploration and presentation of the data and insights.
